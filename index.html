            <h2>The 1990s - The Worldwide Web is Born</h2>
                <p>1990 - At the world’s biggest physics laboratory, CERN in Switzerland,
                     English programmer and physicist Tim Berners-Lee submits two proposals
                     for what will become the Web, starting in March of 1989. Neither is approved.
                     He proceeds anyway, with only unofficial support from his boss and his coworker Robert Cailliau. 
                     By Christmas of 1990 he has prototyped “WorldWideWeb” (as he writes it) in just 
                     three months on an advanced NeXT computer. It features a server, HTML, URLs, and the first browser. 
                     That browser also functions as an editor—like a word processor connected to the Internet – which reflects 
                     his original vision that the Web also incorporate authoring and personal organization tools. 
                     The idea is that a Web of useful links will grow and deepen as people create them in the course of their 
                     daily lives. The Web had been partly inspired by his earlier Enquire program, which had combined networked 
                     hypertext with ideas that would later evolve into the Semantic Web.</p>

            <h2>The 2000s - The USB Flash Drive</h2>
                <p>2000 - USB Flash drives are introduced. Sometimes referred to as jump drives or memory sticks, 
                    these drives consisted of flash memory encased in a small form factor container with a USB interface. 
                    They could be used for data storage and in the backing up and transferring of files between various devices. 
                    They were faster and had greater data capacity than earlier storage media. 
                    Also, they could not be scratched like optical discs and were resilient to magnetic erasure, 
                    unlike floppy disks. Drives for floppy disks and optical discs faded in popularity for desktop PCs and 
                    laptops in favor of USB ports after flash drives were introduced.</p>

            <h2>The 2010s - The Apple iPad is Released</h2>
                <p>The iPad combines many of the popular capabilities of the iPhone, 
                    such as built-in high-definition camera, access to the iTunes Store, 
                    and audio-video capabilities, but with a nine-inch screen and without the phone. 
                    Apps, games, and accessories helped spur the popularity of the iPad and led to its 
                    adoption in thousands of different applications from movie making, creating art, making music, 
                    inventory control and point-of-sale systems, to name but a few. The user interface is built around 
                    the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. All iPads can connect using Wi-Fi; 
                    some models also have cellular connectivity. iPads can shoot video, take photos, play music, 
                    and perform Internet functions such as web-browsing and emailing.</p>

            <h2>The 1980s - Commodore introduces the VIC-20</h2>
                <p>Commodore releases the VIC-20 home computer as the successor to the Commodore PET personal computer. 
                    Intended to be a less expensive alternative to the PET, the VIC-20 was highly successful, 
                    becoming the first computer to sell more than a million units. 
                    Commodore even used Star Trek television star William Shatner in advertisements.</p>

            <h2>The 1970s - Banking Automation Reaches The Customer</h2>
                <p>The ERMA system had revolutionized behind-the-scenes check processing in the 1950s, 
                    spawning the funny letters still at the bottom of checks today. 
                    During the 1960s researchers in various countries have been working on bringing automation – 
                    and online transactions – to customers in the form of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). 
                    Barclay’s Bank in the UK has likely been the first to put one in operation, in 1967. 
                    By decade’s end many systems are up or being planned in Europe and North America. 
                    The paper used by some of the first ATMs is slightly radioactive, to be machine readable. 
                    The 1970s will also see rapid growth in behind-the-scenes financial transaction networks, 
                    like SWIFT for wire transfers.</p>
